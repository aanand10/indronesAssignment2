## <b>Indrones frontend developer Assignment 2</b> : Using Leaflet js, ReactJs and TailwindCss

<hr/>

Needs to build and SPA with the following Components:

- Leaflet Map
- Log Component

### Leaflet Map:

- Map should show a line path between Karjat to Pune Station
- A Marker is created at start which will traverse through that path each second automatically.
- We can shift marker to a specific point on click to a closest point on the map.
- Also, log current position(lat, lng, any text data) of marker each second.

### Log Component:

- This should render current/previous position of marker.
  -Click of any previous position should take that marker to that position on map.
